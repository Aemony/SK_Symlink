# New-SKSymlink

This is a PowerShell based script that automates creating symlinks to SK's DLL files.

This isn't recommended for **anyone** due to the inherent risks of symlinks (in particular symlinked DLL files to potentially non-existent files)!

**DO NOT USE IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHAT YOU ARE DOING!**

Using this script and later on forgetting about having used it, but not properly cleaned the remnants up can leave broken symlinks in folders that end up making games unlaunchable.

**SUPPORT WILL NOT BE GIVEN FOR ANY USERS OF THIS SCRIPT!**
